# This is my first time building a custom Face Tracker from scratch

## My approach will be straight forward from collecting the data and augmenting it to using Transfer Learning and predicting the bounding box

## The whole project will be divided into 4 to 5 parts
1. Getting the Data
2. Labeling them
3. Augment them
4. Model preparation
5. Loss evaluation
6. Final Prediction

## Progress
1. For the preparation of the data I am using open cv and getting 90 to 100 images of my face and label them (DONE)
